# Homey: Airbnb Clone Project

## 📖 About the Project
Homey is a comprehensive clone of Airbnb, designed to simulate the development of a scalable booking platform.  
The focus of the project is to practice full-stack development with an emphasis on backend architecture, API design, database modeling, and security. 

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
This project is designed to help me:  
- Practice collaborative workflows using GitHub  
- Strengthen their understanding of backend architecture and relational data modeling  
- Apply best practices in API development with robust security features  
- Document and plan a real-world project effectively  
- Gain exposure to CI/CD pipelines for continuous deployment and testing  
- Explore integration of modern technologies (e.g., Django, MySQL, GraphQL) in one ecosystem

## 👥 Team Roles
In a real-world environment, a project like Homey involves multiple contributors with different responsibilities.  

- **Project Manager** → Oversees timelines, assigns tasks, and ensures milestones are achieved  
- **Backend Developers** → Build APIs, implement business logic, and integrate external services  
- **Frontend Developers** → Develop user interfaces, connect frontend with backend APIs, and ensure responsiveness  
- **Database Administrator** → Designs and maintains the database schema, ensures performance and security  
- **QA/Testers** → Write test cases, validate functionality, and report issues  
- **DevOps Engineer** → Sets up CI/CD pipelines, manages servers, and automates deployments  
- **Product Owner** → Defines requirements, prioritizes features, and aligns development with project goals  

---

## 🛠 Technology Stack
The Homey project leverages a variety of modern technologies, each serving a specific role:  

- **Django** → Backend framework for building APIs and handling server-side logic  
- **MySQL** → Relational database for structured data storage  
- **GraphQL** → Query language for flexible and efficient data retrieval  
- **Docker** → Containerization for consistent development and deployment  
- **Git & GitHub** → Version control and collaborative workflows  
- **GitHub Actions** → Automating testing, CI/CD, and deployment pipelines

## 🗂 Database Design
The system requires several key entities to represent real-world booking operations.  

- **Users** → Fields: `id`, `name`, `email`, `password`, `role`  
- **Properties** → Fields: `id`, `title`, `description`, `location`, `price`, `owner_id`  
- **Bookings** → Fields: `id`, `user_id`, `property_id`, `start_date`, `end_date`, `status`  
- **Reviews** → Fields: `id`, `user_id`, `property_id`, `rating`, `comment`  
- **Payments** → Fields: `id`, `booking_id`, `amount`, `status`, `payment_date`  

**Relationships:**  
- A **User** can own multiple **Properties**  
- A **Property** can have many **Bookings** and **Reviews**  
- A **Booking** is linked to one **Payment**  
- A **User** can make multiple **Bookings**  

---

## 🚀 Feature Breakdown
The Homey platform provides several core features:  

- **User Management** → Sign up, log in, and manage account details  
- **Property Management** → Owners can add, update, or remove property listings  
- **Search & Filtering** → Users can search listings by location, price, or property type  
- **Booking System** → Users can reserve properties for chosen dates  
- **Review System** → Guests can leave reviews and ratings for properties  
- **Payments** → Secure payment processing for completed bookings  

---

## 🔒 API Security
To ensure the safety and reliability of the platform, several security measures will be implemented:  

- **Authentication & Authorization** → Secure login, user roles, and access restrictions  
- **Data Validation** → Prevent injection attacks and ensure clean input  
- **Rate Limiting** → Protect APIs from abuse and excessive requests  
- **Encrypted Payments** → Securely process financial transactions  
- **Password Hashing** → Store credentials safely with encryption  

Security is essential to protect user data, maintain trust, and prevent breaches in sensitive operations like payments.

---

## ⚙️ CI/CD Pipeline
Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment streamline the development process by automating repetitive tasks.  

- **CI/CD Tools:** GitHub Actions, Docker  
- **Pipeline Stages:**  
  1. **Code Testing** → Run unit and integration tests on every commit  
  2. **Build & Containerization** → Package the app in Docker containers  
  3. **Deployment** → Automatically deploy to staging/production environments  

By using CI/CD, the project ensures faster releases, fewer errors, and a more reliable deployment workflow.
